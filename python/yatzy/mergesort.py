Title:          Merge sort
Description:    Algorithm for sorting Player objects based on their points in descending order
Author:         Teemu PÃ¤tsi
Date:           12th of November 2018
Version:        1.2.1
Python version: 3.6
Usage:          * Keep this file and empty __init__.py in same repository as yatzy.py
		* Must have 'from mergesort import mergesort' line at the beginning of yatzy.py
Notes:		This file is part of yatzy.py file. This game is my a final assignment for Data Structures and Algorithms course in JAMK University of Applied Sciences.

Change log:

2018: 
	12th of November:
		1.1.0   Added exception handler to ensure list only contains integers or floats
		1.1.1   Edited author notes and made some code layout standardizing
	13th of November:
		1.2.0	Done changes for yatzy.py so that my_list is a list of Player objects
		1.2.1	Corrected comments and author notes
